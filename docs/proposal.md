## Research Questions and Usage Scenarios
### Research questions:

1. How does the US gross revenue different by movie genre?

2. What is the relationship between rating and duration of the movie?

3. What are the top 10 rated movies at the year(s) of interest by genre? 
### Scenario of usage:

Kate is a movie enthusiast in the U.S. and she is interested in a broad range of topics and fun facts about the movie industry in North America at different years since 1990. She has a habit to watch a popular movie every week to understand why the movie was so popular in the specific timeframe. She thinks that the best way to understand is to watch it and give her own verdict. Kate also likes doing study how the movie industry is growing and changing by genre popularity and movie duration. She would like to use the gross revenue of movie as an indicator of box office and compare them across genres. As she observed more movies are extending their runtime, she would also like to find out if runtime of a movie is correlated with rating. She could possibly discovers a new trend that the highest rated movie might not be in the same genre that have highest gross revenue (highest box office).

With all these questions in mind, she find having a dashboard with plots and filter by genre and year is useful to answer them. When she logs on to the "movielover app", she can control the filter by genre(s) and year(s) of interest, the dashboard would then displays the following: 

- A list of top 10 rated movie titles with ranking, rating, MPAA rating;
- A bar chart of U.S. gross revenue by genre;
- A scatterplot of U.S. gross revenue and movie runtime.
